Personal Contributions

Lead Front-end Developer

Design/UX Guidance - As a member of the core creative team, I contributed to nearly every aspect of the design process with a critical eye to keeping the UI clean, enhancing UX when possible, and executing the designers' vision while keeping code and DRY and efficient as possible.

Architecture of responsive/fluid page layouts - I developed the core responsive behaviors that carry across the Branded Solutions website, and provided design templates to the designers to help facilitate consistent and predictable layouts.

Umbraco CMS content structure and architecture - My first effort with the Umbraco CMS, I focused on creating a system that allowed for great versatility within the templates, while allowing for managing complex, data-driven content in a repeatable, code-free manner.
