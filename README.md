## Personal Contributions

### Lead Front-end Developer

**Design/UX Guidance** - As a member of the core creative team, I contributed to nearly every aspect of the design process with a critical eye to keeping the UI clean, enhancing UX when possible, and executing the designers' vision while keeping code and DRY and efficient as possible.

**Architecture of responsive/fluid page layouts** - I developed the core responsive behaviors that carry across the Branded Solutions website, and provided design templates to the designers to help facilitate consistent and predictable layouts.

**Umbraco CMS content structure and architecture** - My first effort with the Umbraco CMS, I focused on creating a system that allowed for great versatility within the templates, while allowing for managing complex, data-driven content in a repeatable, code-free manner.

**Custom Javascript/Jquery** - While some plugins have been used, I have written the majority of the Javascript on Branded Solutions fresh to meet the creative and business needs of the project.

## Navigating the code samples

I have included 3 folders in the project which best describe the kinds of content to be found in each: views, css, and js.

### Views

In the views folder I have included several folders that include files related to a specific content type on Branded Solutions. These folders include HTML samples, CSS(SASS), and a folder that includes screenshots of the relevant pages in both desktop and mobile formats in order to provide context.

### CSS

In the css folder I have included many sass files from the project in the same folder structure as the live project, which loosely follows a SMACSS organizational approach.

### JS

In the js folder I have included the main.js file.
